African American Cultural and Heritage Facility,Please let us know if you have any additional feedback about the AACHF's facilities.,"The dance studio floor is consistently dirty, often with debris on the floor which can be hazardous to dancers' feet (small pebbles; I've even found curtain rod hooks and metal wires ON THE FLOOR). The carpet runners provided from the time the facility opened appear to have not been cleaned since they were installed; I have to sweep the floor every time I use the facility. The bathroom is consistently out of soap; the toilet has a nasty ""ring"" in the bowl, as if it hasn't been scrubbed in years, and the floor does not appear to have EVER been mopped! The mirrors are smeared with fingerprints and have ""pock marks""/damage. The ""marley"" covering the floor is puckering and the tape that binds it together is frayed, creating trip hazards. The space in general is WAAY too small; I don't know who decided such a small space was adequate to accommodate the myriad of cultural/artistic needs of the Black community; it appears the space was built without any real thought as to our needs. Instead of a tiny meeting room and tiny dance studio, MUCH larger facilities are needed; in addition to a larger meeting space and dance studio, there should've been a performance hall and SEVERAL meeting rooms (some small, and at least one large one). It appears the powers that be approved the construction of this tiny, inadequate space so it can say they did ""something"" for the Black community. I have been to the Mexican-American Cultural Center and the Asian-American Cultural Center; BOTH have facilities which are FAR-LARGER and more accommodating than the tiny ""bone"" ""thrown"" to Austin Blackfolk. Why was it determined our facility deserved to be the TINIEST and LEAST-APPOINTED?",Negative,false,false,English

It can't be the bustling Mexican-American Cultural Center it was envisioned to be if it's only open during standard business hours during the week when those who would most benefit from it are at work.    For live music, there isn't a large enough indoor open space to accommodate dance space and a stage area.     Lastly, while it is a beautiful building, nothing about the design of the building from the outside suggests that it is a Mexican-American Cultural Center, except the small-ish mural when you're going in the entrance.

We rarely see brown people attending theater plays (it's always the same people, like in a social club). The same companies presenting shows, they don't give a chance to new groups or companies. They're biased towards certain groups, and, even if you make a comment on something it's not accurate, they'll disregard it.

2) I'm 100% Mexican and some of the things the MACC try to portray as Mexican are not accurate. That's one of the things that disenchanted me from the MACC. That, and the lack of support.

Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center,Please let us know if you have any additional thoughts about your experience with staff at the ESB-MACC.,"1) The MACC Manager, Herlinda Zamora, will transfer out of this position March 2020.  Her departure will create a vacuum of wide-scoping Latino/a expertise.  We do the City a disservice to retract to locally focused planning and oversight.  The MACC should be a cultural gem for the entire city and the state -- it certainly has that potential.

2) THE ESB-MACC is a cultural gem.  I served on the Advisory Board as the Mayor's Appointee for 2 years.  Unfortunately, too many issues re. the MACC were driven by political power plays within the Austin Latino/a community.  These were unnecessary distractions resulting in the transfer of the MACC's manager and the loss of her decades of experience with Austin, TX and national Latino/a artists.

3) THE ESB-MACC is a cultural gem. Work on the MACC's expansion needs to begin asap -- even though it appears some community members want to take planning back to the drawing board - again. I served on the Advisory Board as the Mayor's Appointee for 2 years.

While parking is good and the capital metro options are good for getting to Carver, I think the Carver could benefit from a van or bus for summer camp and transporting groups of students and elders in out of schoool time. It would be great to have a van to take people on tours off site that are related to the programs at the Carver and to link the programming to Austin neighborhoods. The operating hours can be confusing and some cultural events only make sense in the evening but it cost more to have events there after hours.
