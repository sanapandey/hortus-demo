The current demo is functional off of public feedback data available in a Yelp dataset, the Austin Cultural Community Center Dataset, and some data provided by the Boston pilot. 

To run the demo locally, clone the repo into your chosen code editor, enter the streamlit directory, and install each of the libraries included in requirements.txt. 

In the terminal, enter 'streamlit run app.py'. This should open a demo of the Trajectory Tracking backend on your local browser.
